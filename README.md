# HR_Analytics_Project_InDetail

This project explores why employees leave a company. We analyze factors like the number of projects they handle, their years of service, department, average work hours, salary, and job satisfaction. By understanding these factors, we can identify trends and patterns that contribute to employee attrition. This knowledge can help HR teams implement strategies to improve employee retention and overall job satisfaction.
